1. Extract parameters from the original set and write them into a
seed file in a ClassBench-like format (i.e. ClassBench can understand this
format but the file also contains statistics not relevant for ClassBench).
Parser should be able to extract parameters from rule sets in an OpenFlow
format, other formats are not necessary. Extracted parameters are as follow:
   1. original ClassBench parameters
   2. probabilities for different rule types (rules with no
   OF-defined header fields are omitted)
   3. parameters for generation of OF-specific header fields
      1. ingress port
      2. vendor part of MAC addresses
      3. Ethernet type
      4. 3 leftmost bits of IP TOS/DSCP
    2. Use ClassBench for generation of the given number of rules.
Each rule will containing all 5-tuple header fields (this is ClassBench's
feature).
3. For each generated rule
   1. determine its OF type
   2. remove 5-tuple header fields that ARE NOT defined by the OF type
   3. add OF-specific header fields that ARE defined by the OF type
      1. if the field is ingress port, Ethernet type or IP protocol,
      use specified dependencies (see shared Google document) to constrain a set
      of possible values for this field
      2. generate value for the OF-specific header field in a
      specified way (see shared Google document)
    4. Label all the header fields by the corresponding OF name
